# amule-win32

[aMule](https://github.com/amule-project/amule) is an eMule-like client for the eDonkey and Kademlia networks. This repository distributes my personal [aMule](https://github.com/amule-project/amule) build for Windows.

## Install

Download the binary files at the [releases](https://github.com/minnyres/amule-win32/releases/) page. There is no need to install. Just extract and use it. 

## Usage

### Use translation

The default GUI language is English. To use translations, select your language at `Preferences->General->Language`.

### Enable GeoIP

With GeoIP aMule shows the country flags of peers. To enable GeoIP, you need to download the [GeoIP data file](https://mailfud.org/geoip-legacy/GeoIP.dat.gz), extract it and place it in aMule's configuration folder, which should be `C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\aMule` in most cases. Then, enable the option "Show country flags for clients" at `Preferences->Interface`.
